Tools You’ll Need to Make Our Best Baked Salmon Recipe
Our baked salmon fillet recipe is really as easy as it gets. A few simple tools and you’ll be forking in no time.

Sheet pan. Depending on the size of your fillet, a half or quarter pan should do quite nicely.
Parchment paper. Did we mention there’s virtually no cleanup? You can thank parchment for that.
Fish spatula. Optional, really. But we do love having one around. Bonus: when you’re not using it to cook fish it makes a great addition to the toddler sensory bin.
